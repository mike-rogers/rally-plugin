This is a Jenkins Plug-in which 
1> pull SCM ChangeSet information from Jenkins Build and updates relevant rally defect or story as a postbuild action.

2> picks up Task details [status, actual hrs, todo hrs etc] from scm comments (if provided) and updates rally task details accordingly.

3> This plugin saves developer efforts of writing check-in hooks for SCM tools (svn, cvs, perforce etc) inorder to update rally changsets which is difficult if organisation uses more than one config management tool.
